# MadStory
A basic python script, where we create a short game inspired by the classic "Mad Libs" for the CLI (Command Line Interface), called Mad Story. The user will take actions that will create a somewhat dark, funny, bizarre or happy story, depending on those decisions that the user made, with an unique character.
